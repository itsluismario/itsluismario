      <p className='text-sm opacity-90 '>
        I've learned that rewards are a byproduct of consistency. I realized this when <label className='px-2 inline-flex rounded-full bg-purple-100 text-purple-800'>I lost 7.5 kilos of body fat.</label> Starting at 18% body fat, I'm now at 10%. I simply committed to 1.5 hours of daily exercise, cut out junk food, and drastically reduced my alcohol intake.

      <p className='text-sm opacity-90 '>
       Additionally, I've reached a <label className='px-2 inline-flex rounded-full bg-purple-100 text-purple-800'>700-day streak</label> on Duolingo.

        Act by Considering the Subconsequences of Your Actions
      </h3>
      <p className='text-sm opacity-90 '>
        When I lost the excess body fat, I never anticipated how great it would feel to be healthy. That's when my second lesson came.

      <h3 className='mb-3 text-md font-semibold'>Collaborating as a Team</h3>
      <p className='text-sm opacity-90 '>
        I have realized that nothing works in isolation; everything needs to be accomplished as a team. Therefore, I have adhered to three principles that have proven to be fantastic: full transparency and total access to information, prioritizing the best idea over position or role, and promptly resolving problems. Whenever I encounter a problem I can&apos;t solve, I make sure to reach out to someone else who can assist.

      <p className='text-sm opacity-90 '>
        As we grow up, we tend to forget to enjoy the process and focus solely on reaching the goal.
