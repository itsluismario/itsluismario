        As being part of Generation Z, after dedicating a reasonable amount of time to reflection, I have concluded that passion and enthusiasm are overrated. What I have discovered and found to be effective is the significance of identifying something that can be sustained in the long term. In this complex and ambiguous system, the key to maintaining stability lies in engaging in activities that bring inner peace.

        Trying to be tolerant, actively listening, and avoiding being egocentric have helped me become a 1% better human being every day and transformed me into the person I would like to meet.

        I have realized that nothing works in isolation; everything needs to be accomplished as a team. Therefore, I have adhered to three principles that have proven to be fantastic: full transparency and providing total access to information, prioritizing the best idea over position or role, and promptly resolving problems. Whenever I encounter a problem I can&apos;t solve, I make sure to reach out to someone else who can assist.
