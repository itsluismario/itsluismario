        I'm an engineer, graduated from Tecnologico de Monterrey, who had the incredible opportunity to work and learn from remarkable change-makers at Harvard: Su Ryon Shin, Phd at Shin Lab, and Banu Ahtam, Phd and Ellen Grant, MD at FNNDSC. Recognizing the privileged position I've been in, I've chosen to dedicate my time to creating companies that solve society's unsolved problems. My goal is to make a meaningful impact and contribute to a better world through computer science.

        However, I also understand my limitations and acknowledge that there is always room for growth. In recent months, I have focused on expanding my technical knowledge to become a well-rounded founder. I believe that continuous learning and self-improvement are essential in order to achieve greatness and drive meaningful change. By amplifying my knowledge and skills, I aim to position myself as a capable and visionary leader in the world of entrepreneurship.
